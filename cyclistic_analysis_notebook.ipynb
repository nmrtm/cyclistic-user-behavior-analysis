Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.    \nUntil now, Cyclistic offers flexible pricing plans:   \n  1. Single-ride passes   \n  2. Full-day passes and \n  3. Annual memberships  \nCustomers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are annual members.\n  Cyclistic’s ﬁnance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more proﬁtable than casual riders. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximising the number of annual members. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.   \n  \n### Stakeholders:    \n1. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing  \n2. Marketing Analytics Team   \n3. Executive Team   \n  \n### Business Task  \n  To identify trends and patterns that differentiate casual riders differ from annual members and use the insights to influence causal riders to become annual members.   \n\n   1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently?  \n   2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?  \n   3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to inﬂuence casual riders to become members?  \n  \n##### Data Source Information:   \n   For this study, data from April 2022 to March 2023 was used.

Executive Summary  \n1. Casual riders take lesser but longer rides than annual members.  \n2. Casual riders are take more and longer rides during the weekends.  \n3. Classic bikes are most popular followed by electric bikes in both member segments. However, docked bikes are only used by causal members for the longest rides.  \n4. Summers are the busiest and winters are the slowest for both rider groups.  \n5. Both groups take the longest rides during late spring and summer.  \n6. The most frequented stations by casual riders are Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Millennium Park, Michigan Ave & Oak St and DuSable Lake Shore Dr & North Blvd.  \n  \n    \n## Recommendations\n1. Provide special offers at the busiest stations, weekends and summer within annual memberships.  \n2. Create competitions based on distance covered and  \n     a) Top contestants could win a full or discounted annual membership or  \n     b) Make these competitions only open to annual members to encourage causal riders to convert to members.   \n     Ideally, these competitions can be done on an app and points can be rewarded for distance.  \n3.
